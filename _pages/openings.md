<h4>Computational Associate</h4>

We, together with <a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/18372" target="_blank">Dr. Michael Honigberg</a>, are jointly seeking a computational associate. The computational associate will work on genetic epidemiology and statistical genetics projects, including polygenic risk score development, rare variant analysis, and genetic association studies. This position is ideal for post-bachelor or post-master students who want to explore research, gain experience, and build their publication record for PhD applications. Both Dr. Honigberg and Dr. Yu have robust publication records and will provide hands-on training and guidance in research and writing, as well as ample opportunities for collaboration (within and outside MGH) and presenting research work.

**Qualifications:** 
- Master’s degree in genetic epidemiology, biostatistics, statistics, or a related field (Bachelor’s degree with experience also welcome).
- (Preferred but not required) Experience analyzing genetics and genomics data, such as GWAS and rare variants.

**Apply:** Please contact Dr. Yu via email with your CV, a short introduction, and details of your research experience.
